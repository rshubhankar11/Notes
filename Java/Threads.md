## Introduction to Threads

A thread is a lightweight sub-process that can execute independently and share resources with other threads. It allows for concurrent execution, enabling a program to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.

## Thread Creation

### Extending Thread Class

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        // Code to be executed in the thread
    }
}

// Creating and starting a thread
MyThread thread = new MyThread();
thread.start();
```

### Implementing Runnable Interface

```java
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        // Code to be executed in the thread
    }
}

// Creating and starting a thread using Runnable
Thread thread = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
thread.start();
```

### Lambda Expressions

```java
// Creating and starting a thread using lambda
Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
    // Code to be executed in the thread
});
thread.start();
```

## Thread States

- **New:** When a thread is created, but the `start()` method hasn't been called.
- **Runnable:** The thread is ready for execution and is waiting for CPU time.
- **Running:** The thread is actively executing its code.
- **Blocked:** The thread is temporarily inactive, usually waiting for a resource or lock.
- **Waiting:** The thread is waiting indefinitely for another thread to perform a particular action.
- **Timed Waiting:** The thread is waiting for a specified period.
- **Terminated:** The thread has completed its execution.

## Thread Synchronization

Synchronization prevents multiple threads from accessing shared resources simultaneously.

```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    // Synchronized method
    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }
}
```

## Thread Communication

Threads can communicate using methods like `wait()`, `notify()`, and `notifyAll()`.

```java
class SharedResource {
    private boolean flag = false;

    synchronized void printEven() throws InterruptedException {
        while (!flag) wait();
        // Print even numbers
        flag = false;
        notify();
    }

    synchronized void printOdd() throws InterruptedException {
        while (flag) wait();
        // Print odd numbers
        flag = true;
        notify();
    }
}
```

## Thread Pools

Thread pools manage a pool of worker threads, improving performance by reusing threads.

```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);
executor.execute(() -> {
    // Thread task
});
executor.shutdown();
```

## Thread Safety

Ensuring thread safety involves preventing data races and unexpected behavior in concurrent programs.

- Use synchronized blocks/methods.
- Use thread-safe data structures.
- Use `volatile` keyword for visibility.
- Use locks and semaphores.

## Advantages and Disadvantages:

## Advantages of Using Threads

1. **Concurrency:** Threads allow multiple tasks to be executed concurrently, maximizing resource utilization and improving performance.

2. **Responsiveness:** Threads enable the application to remain responsive even when some tasks are blocking, as other threads can continue executing.

3. **Parallelism:** Threads can take advantage of multi-core processors, allowing different threads to run on separate cores simultaneously, improving computation-intensive tasks.

4. **Modularity:** Threads enable modular programming by dividing a complex task into smaller threads, each handling a specific aspect of the task.

5. **Efficient Resource Sharing:** Threads share the same process memory space, making it easier to share data and resources compared to separate processes.

6. **Quick Task Startup:** Threads have lower overhead than processes, resulting in faster thread startup times.

## Disadvantages of Using Threads

1. **Complexity:** Threads introduce complexity due to the need for synchronization and coordination between threads to avoid data races and other concurrency-related issues.

2. **Deadlocks:** Improper synchronization can lead to deadlocks where multiple threads are waiting for resources that are held by each other, causing the program to halt.

3. **Race Conditions:** Without proper synchronization, race conditions can occur, leading to unpredictable and incorrect behavior in the program.

4. **Debugging Complexity:** Debugging multi-threaded applications can be challenging due to non-deterministic behavior and intermittent issues that might not be easy to replicate.

5. **Increased Memory Usage:** Each thread comes with some overhead in terms of memory usage, including stack space and thread-specific data structures.

6. **Thread Scheduling Overhead:** Thread scheduling and context switching overhead can reduce performance gains, especially if the number of threads exceeds the available CPU cores.

7. **Performance Bottlenecks:** Poorly designed multi-threaded programs might suffer from bottlenecks due to excessive synchronization, reducing the benefits of parallelism.

8. **Platform Dependent:** Thread behavior can vary between different operating systems and hardware architectures, making it challenging to write truly portable multi-threaded code.

## Important Points to Remember While Implementing Threads

1. **Thread Safety:** Ensure proper synchronization mechanisms are in place to prevent data races and ensure thread safety when accessing shared resources.

2. **Shared Resources:** Identify and manage shared resources such as variables, objects, and data structures to avoid conflicts and inconsistencies.

3. **Synchronization Granularity:** Choose the appropriate level of synchronization granularity. Too fine-grained synchronization can lead to overhead, while too coarse-grained synchronization might limit parallelism.

4. **Deadlock Avoidance:** Be cautious with locks and ensure that threads do not acquire multiple locks in different orders, as this can lead to deadlocks.

5. **Resource Release:** Always release acquired resources like locks, semaphores, and I/O handles to avoid resource leaks and potential deadlocks.

6. **Thread Interruption:** Use the `interrupt()` method judiciously for thread termination. Handle interruptions properly and consider thread interruption policies.

7. **Volatile Keyword:** Understand the use of the `volatile` keyword to ensure proper visibility of variables among threads and prevent caching issues.

8. **Thread Termination:** Plan how threads will be terminated gracefully. Sudden thread termination might leave resources in an inconsistent state.

9. **Exception Handling:** Wrap thread code in try-catch blocks to catch exceptions. Unhandled exceptions in threads can lead to unexpected application behavior.

10. **Thread Priorities:** Use thread priorities with caution. Thread priority mechanisms might not be consistent across different operating systems.

11. **Testing:** Test the multi-threaded code thoroughly. Race conditions and other concurrency-related bugs might be hard to reproduce and debug.

12. **Thread Naming:** Assign meaningful names to threads, especially in applications with many threads, to aid in debugging and logging.

13. **Thread Communication:** Use appropriate thread communication mechanisms like `wait()`, `notify()`, and `notifyAll()` to coordinate between threads.

14. **Avoid Global Variables:** Minimize the use of global variables across threads to reduce contention and improve code maintainability.

15. **Resource Contentions:** Be aware of potential resource contention, such as shared locks, that might impact performance negatively.

16. **Thread Profiling:** Use profiling tools to analyze thread behavior and identify bottlenecks and performance issues.

17. **Design Patterns:** Consider using design patterns like Thread Pool, Producer-Consumer, and Fork-Join to simplify thread management and improve performance.

18. **Documentation:** Document the threading strategy and any synchronization mechanisms used, as well as potential pitfalls and solutions.

19. **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews, especially for multi-threaded code, to catch design and implementation issues early.

20. **Monitoring and Debugging:** Implement proper monitoring and debugging mechanisms to track thread activities, identify issues, and improve troubleshooting.

Certainly, here's the addition regarding threads in Java 8 and how to create threads using the new features along with an example:

## Thread in Java 8 and Thread Creation

In Java 8, the language introduced a new way to create threads using lambda expressions and the `java.util.concurrent` package, making it more concise and expressive. This new approach simplifies the process of creating and managing threads.

### Creating Thread in Java 8

```java
public class Java8ThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Using lambda expression to create a thread
        Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                System.out.println("Thread ID: " + Thread.currentThread().getId() + ", Value: " + i);
            }
        });

        // Starting the thread
        thread.start();
    }
}
```

## New Things Added in Java 8 for Threads

Java 8 introduced the concept of the `CompletableFuture` class, which provides a higher-level abstraction for managing asynchronous tasks and handling their results. It offers more flexibility and composability compared to traditional threads and callbacks.

### CompletableFuture Example

```java
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException;

public class CompletableFutureExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException {
        CompletableFuture<Integer> future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
            // Simulate a time-consuming task
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
            return 42;
        });

        // Perform actions when the task completes
        future.thenAccept(result -> System.out.println("Result: " + result));

        // Wait for the future to complete and retrieve the result
        int result = future.get();
        System.out.println("Final Result: " + result);
    }
}
```

In this example, `CompletableFuture.supplyAsync()` starts an asynchronous task that returns a value. The `thenAccept()` method specifies what to do with the result when the task completes. The `future.get()` call blocks until the result is available.

Java 8's `CompletableFuture` offers improved handling of asynchronous tasks, exception handling, chaining of multiple tasks, and combining tasks in a more elegant and readable manner.

## Conclusion

Java 8 introduced the ability to create threads using lambda expressions and improved thread management with the `CompletableFuture` class. These features simplify the process of handling concurrency and asynchronous tasks, enhancing the efficiency and readability of Java applications.

## Important interview Questions

1. **What is a thread in Java?**

   A thread in Java is a lightweight, independent path of execution within a program. It allows concurrent execution of tasks, enabling a program to perform multiple operations concurrently.

2. **What are the two ways to create a thread in Java?**

   Threads can be created by either extending the `Thread` class or implementing the `Runnable` interface.

3. **What is the difference between extending `Thread` class and implementing `Runnable` interface for creating threads?**

   Extending the `Thread` class limits the ability to extend other classes, whereas implementing the `Runnable` interface allows better flexibility by avoiding class inheritance. In general, implementing `Runnable` is preferred because it separates the task from thread management.

4. **What is the `start()` method used for in a Java thread?**

   The `start()` method is used to begin the execution of a thread. It initializes the thread's call stack and invokes the `run()` method.

5. **Explain the `run()` method in a Java thread.**

   The `run()` method contains the code that the thread will execute. It's the entry point for the task that the thread is supposed to perform.

6. **What is thread synchronization? Why is it important?**

   Thread synchronization is the process of coordinating multiple threads to ensure that they access shared resources in a controlled manner. It prevents data races and maintains data integrity. Without synchronization, concurrent threads can lead to unpredictable and incorrect results.

7. **What is the purpose of the `synchronized` keyword in Java?**

   The `synchronized` keyword is used to define critical sections of code that can be accessed by only one thread at a time. It prevents multiple threads from accessing the synchronized block or method simultaneously, ensuring thread safety.

8. **What is a deadlock, and how can it be avoided?**

   Deadlock is a situation where two or more threads are blocked, each waiting for a resource held by another thread. Deadlocks can be avoided by ensuring that threads acquire locks in a consistent order and by using mechanisms like timeout or using non-blocking algorithms.

9. **What are the states of a thread's lifecycle?**

   The states of a thread's lifecycle are New, Runnable, Running, Blocked, Waiting, Timed Waiting, and Terminated.

10. **Explain the `wait()`, `notify()`, and `notifyAll()` methods in Java threads.**

    - `wait()`: Causes the current thread to wait until another thread notifies it.
    - `notify()`: Wakes up one waiting thread that is in the queue to acquire a lock.
    - `notifyAll()`: Wakes up all waiting threads in the queue.

11. **What is a thread pool, and why is it beneficial?**

    A thread pool is a managed collection of worker threads that are available to execute tasks. It improves performance by reusing threads, reducing thread creation overhead, and controlling the number of concurrently executing threads.

12. **Explain the concept of thread safety and how it's achieved.**

    Thread safety ensures that data accessed by multiple threads is not subject to race conditions. It's achieved by using synchronization mechanisms like locks, semaphores, and using thread-safe data structures.

13. **What is the purpose of the `volatile` keyword in Java?**

    The `volatile` keyword ensures that a variable's value is always read from and written to the main memory, rather than from local caches. It's used for variables that are accessed by multiple threads without performing additional synchronization.

14. **What is the Java Memory Model (JMM)?**

    The Java Memory Model defines the rules and guarantees for how threads interact with memory and each other. It ensures proper visibility and ordering of memory operations across different threads.

15. **Explain the concept of race conditions. How can they be mitigated?**

    A race condition occurs when two or more threads access shared data simultaneously, leading to unpredictable and incorrect results. They can be mitigated by proper synchronization mechanisms like locks and using atomic operations.
