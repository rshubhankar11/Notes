# HashMap vs LinkedHashMap vs ConcurrentHashMap

`HashMap`, `LinkedHashMap`, and `ConcurrentHashMap` are all implementations of the `Map` interface in Java, used to store key-value pairs. They differ in their characteristics and usage scenarios:

1. `HashMap`: This is a basic implementation that provides fast constant-time performance for inserting, retrieving, and removing elements. However, it doesn't guarantee any specific order for its elements.

2. `LinkedHashMap`: This implementation maintains the order of elements based on the order in which they were inserted. It's useful when you need to maintain the insertion order of elements.

3. `ConcurrentHashMap`: This is designed to support concurrent operations, making it suitable for multi-threaded environments. It offers higher concurrency by dividing the map into segments, allowing multiple threads to operate on different segments concurrently. It also provides methods for atomic operations and better performance in concurrent scenarios.

Your choice between them depends on your specific use case. Use `HashMap` when order doesn't matter and you don't need thread safety. Choose `LinkedHashMap` when you need to maintain insertion order. Opt for `ConcurrentHashMap` when you need thread-safe operations in a concurrent environment.

Remember that the specific trade-offs and capabilities of these classes can change over different versions of Java, so always refer to the official documentation for the most up-to-date information.

## HashMap

- Stores key-value pairs.
- No guaranteed order of elements.
- Not synchronized, not thread-safe.
- Provides O(1) average time complexity for insertion, retrieval, and deletion.
- May result in `ConcurrentModificationException` when modified during iteration.

## LinkedHashMap

- Maintains insertion order of elements.
- Inherits characteristics of HashMap.
- Allows for iteration in the order of insertion.
- Slightly slower than HashMap due to maintaining order.
- Not synchronized, not thread-safe.

## ConcurrentHashMap

- Supports concurrent operations.
- Divided into segments, allowing multiple threads to operate concurrently.
- Achieves higher throughput in multi-threaded scenarios.
- Provides thread-safe operations without locking the entire map.
- Trade-off between synchronization and performance.

## Table

Certainly! Here's a table comparing `HashMap`, `LinkedHashMap`, and `ConcurrentHashMap`:
