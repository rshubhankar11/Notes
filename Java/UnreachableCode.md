# Unreachable Code in Java

Unreachable code in Java refers to a section of code that the compiler determines cannot be executed during the program's runtime. This often occurs due to logical or structural issues within the code.

Consider the following corrected example:

```java
public class UnreachableCodeExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        return;
        System.out.println("This line is unreachable.");
    }
}
```

In this example, the line `System.out.println("This line is unreachable.");` is unreachable because it appears after the `return` statement. The `return` statement terminates the execution of the method, making any code following it unreachable.

Identifying and removing unreachable code is crucial to maintain clean and error-free code. Unreachable code can indicate logical flaws or unnecessary statements that should be addressed for better code quality.
