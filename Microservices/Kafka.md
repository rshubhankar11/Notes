# Apache Kafka Tutorial

## Introduction to Apache Kafka

Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications.

## Key Concepts

### Topics

- Notes: Topics are logical channels used to categorize data streams.
- Example: Create a topic named "my-topic" for storing user events.

### Producers

- Notes: Producers publish data to Kafka topics.
- Example: Create a producer to send user activity data to "my-topic".

### Consumers

- Notes: Consumers subscribe to topics and process the published data.
- Example: Develop a consumer to read and process data from "my-topic".

### Partitions

- Notes: Topics are divided into partitions to enable parallelism and scalability.
- Example: Configure a topic with multiple partitions to handle high data throughput.

### Consumer Groups

- Notes: Consumers can be grouped to work together on processing data from a topic.
- Example: Create two consumer groups for fault tolerance and load distribution.

### Brokers

- Notes: Brokers are Kafka servers that store data and manage topics.
- Example: Set up multiple Kafka brokers for fault tolerance.

## Getting Started

### Installation

- Notes: Download and install Kafka on your system.
- Example: Use package manager or download Kafka from the official website.

### Starting Kafka

- Notes: Start ZooKeeper and Kafka server.
- Example: Run `zookeeper-server-start` and `kafka-server-start` commands.

### Creating a Topic

- Notes: Use Kafka command-line tools to create a topic.
- Example: `kafka-topics --create --topic my-topic --partitions 3 --replication-factor 1 --bootstrap-server localhost:9092`

### Producing Data

- Notes: Create a Kafka producer to send data to a topic.
- Example: Implement a Java/Python producer to send user events to "my-topic".

### Consuming Data

- Notes: Develop a Kafka consumer to read and process data from a topic.
- Example: Build a Java/Python consumer to process events from "my-topic".

### Consumer Groups

- Notes: Create multiple consumers in a group to consume data in parallel.
- Example: Launch two consumers in a group to process events from "my-topic".

## Advanced Topics (to be expanded)

- Kafka Connect: Using connectors for integrating Kafka with other systems.
- Kafka Streams: Building stream processing applications using Kafka Streams API.
- Security: Configuring SSL and authentication for secure communication.
- Monitoring and Management: Tools and techniques for monitoring Kafka clusters.

## Conclusion

Apache Kafka is a powerful tool for building real-time data pipelines and stream processing applications.
