Below is a table comparing SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) and REST (Representational State Transfer) based on various characteristics:

| Characteristic    | SOAP                                           | REST                                                |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Protocol          | Protocol-based: Uses XML over HTTP, SMTP, etc. | Protocol-agnostic: Usually uses HTTP(S)             |
| Message Format    | XML                                            | JSON, XML, or other formats                         |
| Message Standards | Follows WS-\* standards (e.g., WS-Security)    | No strict standards enforced, more flexible         |
| Statefulness      | Stateful                                       | Stateless                                           |
| Communication     | Requires more bandwidth due to XML overhead    | Requires less bandwidth due to compact JSON data    |
| Operations        | CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) | Uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) |
| Error Handling    | SOAP faults                                    | HTTP status codes and custom error messages         |
| Security          | Built-in security with WS-Security             | Usually relies on HTTPS for security                |
| Flexibility       | Less flexible due to strict standards          | More flexible, easy to implement and evolve         |
| Usage             | Typically used in enterprise environments      | Widely used in web and mobile applications          |
| Tool Support      | Requires specific toolkits for parsing XML     | Can be easily consumed using HTTP libraries         |

Remember that the choice between SOAP and REST depends on the project requirements, existing infrastructure, and the specific use case. While SOAP is still prevalent in some enterprise systems, REST has become more popular for building modern web services due to its simplicity, flexibility, and ease of use.

Here's the information presented in a table format:

| Aspect                  | SOAP                                     | REST                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Full Form               | Simple Object Access Protocol            | Representational State Transfer                          |
| Description             | Protocol used to implement web services  | Architectural design pattern for developing web services |
| Compatibility with REST | Cannot use REST as it is a protocol      | Can use SOAP protocol as part of the implementation      |
| Standards               | Strictly follows specific standards      | Defines standards but not strictly enforced              |
| Client-Server Coupling  | Tightly coupled, similar to desktop apps | Loosely coupled, more flexible like a browser            |
| Data Formats            | Supports only XML transmission           | Supports multiple formats (XML, JSON, MIME, Text, etc.)  |
| Cacheability of Reads   | Reads are not cacheable                  | Read requests can be cached                              |
| Resource Exposition     | Uses service interfaces for exposure     | Uses URIs for exposing resource logic                    |
| Speed                   | Slower                                   | Faster                                                   |
| Security Measures       | Defines its own security measures        | Inherits security measures based on the implementation   |
| Preference              | Less commonly preferred                  | Commonly preferred by developers due to scalability      |

Please note that the information provided is a summary of the main differences between SOAP and REST, and there may be more aspects to consider depending on specific use cases and requirements.
